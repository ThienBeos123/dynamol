/** ----------- Heap-based BigInt Greatest Common Divisor -----------
 * THIS FILE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING ALGORITHMS:
 *
 *      - Half-GCD (Helper, Size-reducing algorithm)
 *      - Subquadratic-GCD (Full-fledge GCD, utilizes Half-GCD and Lehmer GCD)
 *
 * This file is a complexity-delegated file, specifically containing the implementation
 * of the algorithm as detailed above. Other bigInt algorithm GCD files include
 *
 *      - gcd.c (Algorithm Dispatcher + Implementation of Binary and Lehmer GCD)
 *      - mv_matmul/_mv_matmul_disp.c (Algorithm Dispatcher of Matrix-Vector Multiplication Algorithms)
 *      - mv_matmul/_mv_matmul_ws.c (Workspace Size Returning Dispatcher of Matrix-Vector Multiplication Algorithms)
 *      - ...
 *
 * For the ... at the end, it basically means that every single file inside /mv_matmul is, considerably,
 * under the direct implementation scope of GCD, as it was initially implemented as efficient
 * algorithms for calculating the transformation matrix T for Half-GCD, but was then generalized for future uses (xGCD)
