/* Note - STORAGE SETUP: 
*   +) Further intialization protocols for fail_ebuf parts (str_res)
*      is not needed in STOBI Function groups, as they utilize ectx_buf
*      as the storage unit for their bigInt results, and therefore the size
*      would be accurate for storage since we're using pointer-based storage
*      instead of header-based FAM storage
* 
*   +) However, for BITOS Function groups, it is absolutely necessary 
*      to declare the failure-handling storage for edge cases to be raw
*      bytes (uint8_t preferred for cross platform compatibility, but
*      unsigned char is partly acceptable), initializing with the formula:
* 
*           bufsize = ((sizeof(str_res) + MAXIMUM_CAP) * *_ecount << 1) * *_scount
* 
*      Where:
*           - bufsize: The size of the failure-handling buffer that contains both the
*                      storage of expected output and output
*           - MAXIMUM_CAP: The upperbound/most memory usage an edge case could've possible used
*                          for its output. Setting it as STR_CAP is only acceptable during
*                          prototypical stages, and must be replaced with the correct, peak memory
*                          usage that a case can use for its output
*           - *_ecount: The amount of edge cases for specific operation 
*                       (replace * with the operation name) 
*           - *_scount: The amount of suites that is needed to holistically test the entire function
*                       category (containing all of its variants)
*     
*      Afterwards, usage can be either implicitly interpreted as spaces of a str_res struct header,
*      for _strui.h automatically interprets such inputted buffers for edge case as str_res, or,
*      preferrably, explicit through type-casting.
